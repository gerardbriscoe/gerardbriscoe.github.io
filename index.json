However, many digital platforms still lack the inclusiveness required for all older people to use and engage with them. Some using technology frequently meet a digital world unsuited to their cognitive, sensory, functional and socio-emotional abilities. So, their digital experience seldom aligns with their digital literacy, or personal wants and needs. As most digital platforms are not designed for older people, they are more likely to require assistance to use them. This can impact financial resilience, health, and sense of belonging. To encourage platform developers to utilise an inclusive design approach, to better consider the needs of older people, we created guidance for developing age-inclusive digital platforms. This involved focus groups, interviews, and user testing. We analysed older peoples? use cases, interviewed development teams and reviewed best practices worldwide. This resulted in a Hebrew-language booklet for developers and designers, which we recently translated to English. With initial adoption, we are starting to see these principles implemented in Israeli government and municipal digital services. We hope to create further meaningful change in the usability of digital platforms to improve the lives of older people, including our future selves.","tags":[],"title":"Age inclusive digital platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G Briscoe","I Gadzheva","I Nazerali"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674097969,"objectID":"0b7eef8f8c2832e2477043bb5816e252","permalink":"https://gerardbriscoe.github.io/publication/include-beyond/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T03:12:49.115639Z","relpermalink":"/publication/include-beyond/","section":"publication","summary":"Ageism is a relatively modern construct arising from significant increases in life expectancy. For example, Stone Age representations of older people simply noted differences in hair colour. Frailty stereotypes are unrepresentative, because the majority of older people have diverse functional capacity. Nonetheless, ageism within the media is widespread, with older people, even in contemporary dramas, often limited to stereotypes of snowy-haired invisible grandparents or homeless people. Similarly, prevalent icons of older people often utilise stereotypes of physical frailty. A notable example is the 1981 United Kingdom road sign for slower, frail people crossing the road, which is designed to notify drivers to reduce vehicle speed. It depicts a frailty narrative that has become the archetype for iconography of older people. Such stereotypes lead to the design of digital technologies focusing on healthcare, rather than desires and aspirations. So, we suggest an alternative iconography for older people, moving beyond stereotypical physical frailty, and approaches to addressing ageism stereotypes in wider society through popular media. We conclude by moving beyond ageing stereotypes, counterbalancing the mostly negative ones to affect changes in perceptions of popular culture, which is critical not only for the older people of today, but also our future selves.","tags":[],"title":"Beyond ageing stereotypes: Imagery \u0026 iconography","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Again, considering the ‘tyranny of measurement’ from ever-increasing KPIs, and as suggested by a colleague The Charge of the Light Brigade poem as a suitable metaphor, the following emerged:\nHalf a KPI, half a KPI,\nHalf a KPI onward,\nAll in the valley of Impact\nRode the PhDs.\n‘Forward, the Researchers!\nCharge for publication!’ she said:\nInto the valley of Impact\nRode the PhDs.\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"0e02b8a21d3aa5813bf51ef04866c383","permalink":"https://gerardbriscoe.github.io/portfolio/chargeoftheresearchers/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/portfolio/chargeoftheresearchers/","section":"portfolio","summary":"Another poem of key performance indicators in academia.","tags":null,"title":"Charge of The Researchers","type":"portfolio"},{"authors":["G Briscoe","G Ramster"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674097969,"objectID":"1000de5d8e5e14302f7a845280a738c4","permalink":"https://gerardbriscoe.github.io/publication/hcd/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T03:12:49.575953Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hcd/","section":"publication","summary":"Factors such as population growth, urban migration and  climate change, are placing ever greater demands on health around the world. Cities are becoming the frontline in providing the future of healthcare, with more than half of the world?s population now living in urban environments, which is forecasted to be nearly 70% by 2050. There is therefore a growing need to identify emerging and future challenges that cities will face, identifying trends for priority issues such as ageing populations, pandemic risks and climate change. As well as indicators of current and expected future readiness for these challenges. We used design research to determine emerging and future challenges for cities to deliver healthcare. This included 8 forty minute phone interviews and 6 workshops with subject matter experts in healthcare provision from cities across three continents (North America, Europe, Africa), as well as literature reviews. The 3 speculative design workshops involved participatory design research, exploring design futures to identify emerging and likely future challenges. The qualitative data collected was synthesised with existential risks identified from literature reviews, grouping key challenges. We then, through creative engagement approaches with experts and designers in a final workshop, identified potential indicators for these key challenges. We have determined emerging and likely future challenges for health in cities, ranging from social cohesion to emerging technologies, including age friendliness, green space, and drug resistance. Grouping them into four areas: ?ageing \u0026 lifestyle?, ?environment \u0026 climate?, ?innovation \u0026 technology?, and ?other existential risks?. For ?ageing \u0026 lifestyle? identifying indicators for lifestyle conditions, work-life balance, managing conditions, and supporting independence. For ?environment \u0026 climate? identifying indicators for the built environment, climate change, green economy, and the social environment. For ?innovation \u0026 technology? identifying indicators for cultures of innovation, digital infrastructure, emerging technologies, and innovative practices. For ?other existential risks? identifying indicators for pandemics, antibiotic resistance, and anti-vaccination. By synthesising the knowledge of experts with literature reviews, we have determined the key emerging and future challenges facing cities. We have categorised these into four areas, and identified indicators for current and future readiness. Knowing these likely health challenges, we can prepare to manage them better. Furthermore, policymakers and researchers, working in public health and healthcare provision, can make use of the identified indicators. Next steps would be to collate and extract data for individual cities, for example by these cities for direct action or by a third party for comparative study.","tags":[],"title":"Future health challenges for cities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G Briscoe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674097968,"objectID":"ce108a27f7490f4e9ac2875ca20bc7aa","permalink":"https://gerardbriscoe.github.io/publication/mat-fur/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T03:12:48.816625Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mat-fur/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the enduring propositions of technology futures is the crafting of material artefacts with Internet connectivity, allowing for the embodiment of a congruent digital shadow as exemplified in Figure 1. Such propositions have a long history, dating back to the 1990s, which saw the rise of the Internet and the ongoing miniaturisation of transistors for the rise of mobile phones. It was envisaged that these resources could be successfully combined to achieve the complexity and scale required for the Internet of Things (IoT). Also, this provides such propositions with the opportunity to evolve with our cultural aspirations, while reflecting on the current state of perceived technological development. So, we consider to what extent past technology futures of digital materiality for the IoT have been realised, including hybrid artefacts that are transcendent across the physical and the digital, between the material and the immaterial. While these 'technology futures' have been proffered through many media depictions, seemingly heading towards everyday environments, the vast majority never arrive. We therefore propose a model for understanding, from a speculative design approach, the pathways of how emerging technologies become realised in real-world applications and technology-related imaginaries, as well as how they ?could? be realised in credible near- futures. We also suggest reasons why these future visions of the IoT in everyday environments so often fail to be realised, and how to present more plausible depictions. This includes understanding failed propositions focused on utilitarian artefacts, and better understanding material culture for the ubiquitous embodiment of digital materiality in plausible depictions. We conclude by considering what is required for credible, engaging and critical speculations on understanding digital materiality for the IoT, including potentially preferable futures of connecting all human-made objects in the world to the Internet, as summarised in Graph 1.","tags":[],"title":"Material futures past: Digital materiality of The Internet of Things","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G Briscoe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674097969,"objectID":"20ea4678a5bc14de25846c7d41287b53","permalink":"https://gerardbriscoe.github.io/publication/arc/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T03:12:49.419905Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arc/","section":"publication","summary":"Ageing populations are driving a considerable and growing proportion of world economic activity.

The paper makes the case for developing an age-friendly design lens to reorient the work of designers around the changing needs of older people, based on the values of inclusive design.

Ageing populations are diverse, and so requires design to understand and reflect this diversity. Defining people by chronological age often means segmenting them into age groups (e.g. 65+, in your 80s, etc.), or generational cohorts such as 'the baby boomers' and 'the greatest generation'. These constructed groups leave little space for diversity, even though older populations are much more diverse than younger populations, in terms of capacity and health. This is not conducive to understanding what an individual ageing person wants, desires and requires from design solutions. Perceptions of ageism and ageing stereotypes can significantly affect how ageing is understood in design, across different scales from the individual to society. Historically, design as a problem-solving practice has adopted a medical view on ageing, so responding to older people as patients in need of assistive aids and devices. These responses then reaffirm ageist stereotypes, through the products and services designed, as well as the language used to describe them. Designers should consider to what extent the types of products, their aesthetics, and the environments in which they are used by older people can influence, negatively or positively, societal perceptions of them as well as perceptions of themselves. We discuss the potential for design research to identify more accurate and nuanced types and typologies of ageing, rather than reproducing old and outdated stereotypes. So, how to move towards understanding and presenting ageing people in more diverse ways. Furthermore, how design research methods contribute to studying and reflecting this diversity and different types of ageing. Therefore, we consider ageing stereotypes, negative and positive, moving beyond them towards typologies of ageing for designing inclusively, reflecting real lived experiences of current and future generations of older people. This naturally requires including older people in design research, and utilising their diverse lived experiences as a resource. We argue this will provide a better approach to understanding ageing when creating preferable design solutions. Furthermore, this could help change the narratives of ageing in design and subsequently within society.","tags":[],"title":"Design for ageing: Beyond stereotypes to lived experience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G Briscoe","S Carroll"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674097970,"objectID":"d12499f39c379a27dbfd8ec24cc2c880","permalink":"https://gerardbriscoe.github.io/publication/ifa-mine/","publishdate":"2023-01-19T03:12:49.876702Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ifa-mine/","section":"publication","summary":"The United Nations has identified population ageing as a global phenomenon, with virtually every country in the world experiencing growth in the size and proportion of older persons in their populations. Specifically, the share of the population 65 plus will increase from 9% in 2019 to 16% by 2050, more than doubling from 703 million to 1.5 billion. In this context, AgeTech is expected to be a $2.7 trillion global industry by 2025, based upon having a 10% share of the growing global Longevity Economy. So, companies and investors are understandably interested in technology that would bring living longer closer to living well. While the promise of such technology is preferable, the approach of AgeTech to be exclusively designed for older people is problematic; as lacking Inclusive Design in the initial development of digital technologies cannot be remedied by further lacking Inclusive Design in subsequent specialist AgeTech. Such specialist products and services would be inherently limited, even assuming gender and ethnic inclusivity. They would likely be crisis purchases bought because of need rather than desire, lacking appeal because of potential or perceived stigma. This is because such ageism can significantly affect how ageing is understood in design, for example the notion of 'senior' can be associated with illness and/or disability. However, it can be estimated, at least for developed countries, that the majority of seniors are fully physically and mentally able. For example, in the United Kingdom, from their Office for National Statistics data, 58% of those at or above state pension age (i.e. senior) are fully physically and mentally able; and for Canada, from their Statistics Canada data, the proportion is similarly estimated to be 62%. So, designers and developers need to move beyond ageist stereotypes as ageing populations are diverse, requiring design to understand and embody their diversity. Therefore, we consider moving beyond ageist stereotypes, negative and positive, in designing preferable technology futures of living well longer. Positive stereotypes can also be harmful, for example sageism, in which the notion of 'elder' can create expectations on older people that cannot subsequently be met. Overall, adopting Inclusive Design in the development of digital technologies would ensure usefulness and appeal to adults of all ages, for inclusive rather than ageist technology.","tags":[],"title":"Inclusive Design: To AgeTech or not to AgeTech?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project Site\nA simple counter, using an appropriate image being shared on Twitter at the time, for the end of the US presidential term.

However, with current corporate culture it can be unclear who owns a given brand, and so whether the owner’s values are consistent with the brand’s values.\nI created a tool to determine the ownership of a brand. I wanted as self-sustaining a solution as far as possible, so rather than build a complex server to handle queries, I looked for a primarily client-side solution. I realised I needed a suitable data source, such as Wikipedia, and a suitable way to access information (API) as client-side data scraping would not be effective. I discovered DBpedia which makes Wikipedia information available in a database format, such that queries can be submitted in the SPARQL query language.

Conscious of the need to retain a sense of touch, rather than a stylus with a conductive tip or gloves with conductive finger tips, we then propose suitable thimbles for touchscreens. We conceptualised a touchscreen thimble to be worn on the body that would maintain a sense of touch.

Considering from a phenomenological perspective the theory of experience. Including how perception can be seen in a manifold perspective, in which consciousness and intentionality is the source of artefacts and experience. Furthermore, from a computational perspective we consider moving beyond traditional representational perspectives of perception. So, considering subjective experiences, rather than copying characteristics of experience. Adopting consciousness in its intentionality, the direction of consciousness to something, as a counterpoint to representational formulations of perception. We then consider creating context aware art, in which interactions through an interface are to experience, perceive and inhabit virtual environments. So, serving as a gateway to the mental processing involved in the interpretation of informational contents. Therefore, the interface as a medium of interaction must be based upon constantly reforming spatial configurations. Thereby forming a congruence of the interaction between the individual and the virtual environment, based on the exchange of stimuli between users and cognition, via the interface. This allows for better acquisition of context, the abstraction and understanding of context, and behaviour based on context recognition.\nConsidering an example in which contexts of social media are linked to a dynamic interpretation of Mondrian’s Composition II.\nMondrian believed that colours should be kept separate and pure. He uses only black and white and the primary colours of red, yellow and blue.\nAccording to Mondrian colour has vibrations in the same way as music, which gives them a sense of movement when you look at them. So, different colours have different personalities.\nIn social media, context awareness is a construction of societies based on reality, and should therefore be aware of the history and context surrounding social interactions. We therefore link areas of activity to colour, and relative intensity of activity to form. So, creating a live piece of artwork, potentially enriching to the soul, as well as informative of online social experiences.
