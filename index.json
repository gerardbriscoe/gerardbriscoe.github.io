I noted that perhaps more simply what was required was knowledge of brand ownership, rather than the full history of a product’s origin, because one ultimately has to believe the information that would be placed on a blockchain. However, with current corporate culture it can be unclear who owns a given brand, and so whether the owner’s values are consistent with the brand’s values.\nI created a tool to determine the ownership of a brand. I wanted as self-sustaining a solution as far as possible, so rather than build a complex server to handle queries, I looked for a primarily client-side solution. I realised I needed a suitable data source, such as Wikipedia, and a suitable way to access information (API) as client-side data scraping would not be effective. I discovered DBpedia which makes Wikipedia information available in a database format, such that queries can be submitted in the SPARQL query language. I wanted a responsive web design that would provide a web app, as well as a website.

We have created and e-mail relay that achieves the same effect for an individual, as it interfaces between a user’s devices and their email accounts.

This connects craftsmanship to the tradition of upholding standards and taking time, as a source of respect and self-worth. Among those standards are the tools and practices used in crafting.\nIt has been considered that thinking through the tools we use encourages us to cultivate a form of material consciousness. So, we should consider that to use a machine is to judge its powers, fashion its uses, in light of our limits rather than its potential. We should feel the material specificity of the medium we handle, to appreciate the incompleteness, the possibility, of a design that is not provided by a machine as a fait accompli. Furthermore, asserting our own individuality against the prepackaged, predetermined limitations of the tools we use. Therefore, a significant element of craftsmanship is being a toolsmith to adapt and develop one’s own tools.\nWe considered precision soldering for crafting digitally enabled artefacts, which necessitated the creation of a prototype precision soldering iron.

Considering from a phenomenological perspective the theory of experience. Including how perception can be seen in a manifold perspective, in which consciousness and intentionality is the source of artefacts and experience. Furthermore, from a computational perspective we consider moving beyond traditional representational perspectives of perception. So, considering subjective experiences, rather than copying characteristics of experience. Adopting consciousness in its intentionality, the direction of consciousness to something, as a counterpoint to representational formulations of perception. We then consider creating context aware art, in which interactions through an interface are to experience, perceive and inhabit virtual environments. So, serving as a gateway to the mental processing involved in the interpretation of informational contents. Therefore, the interface as a medium of interaction must be based upon constantly reforming spatial configurations. Thereby forming a congruence of the interaction between the individual and the virtual environment, based on the exchange of stimuli between users and cognition, via the interface. This allows for better acquisition of context, the abstraction and understanding of context, and behaviour based on context recognition.\nConsidering an example in which contexts of social media are linked to a dynamic interpretation of Mondrian’s Composition II.\nMondrian believed that colours should be kept separate and pure. He uses only black and white and the primary colours of red, yellow and blue.\nAccording to Mondrian colour has vibrations in the same way as music, which gives them a sense of movement when you look at them. So, different colours have different personalities.\nIn social media, context awareness is a construction of societies based on reality, and should therefore be aware of the history and context surrounding social interactions. We therefore link areas of activity to colour, and relative intensity of activity to form.
