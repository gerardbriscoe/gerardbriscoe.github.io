I noted that perhaps more simply what was required was knowledge of brand of products, rather than the full history of a product’s origin, because after all one has to believe the information that would be placed on a blockchain. However, given current corporate culture it can be unclear who own’s a brand, and whether the owner’s values are consistent with a brand’s values.\nI created a tool to determine the ownership of a brand or company. I wanted as self-sustaining solution as possible, so rather than build a complex server to handle queries, I looked for a primarily client-side solution. I realised I need a suitable data source, such as Wikipedia, and a suitable way access interface (API) as client-side data scrapping of wikipedia would not be effective. I discovered DBpedia which make Wikipedia information available in a database format, such that one can submit queries in SPARQL query language. I wanted a responsive web design that would provide a web app, as well as a website. I considered that the Skeleton CSS library would be sufficient for my needs if building prototype interface.\nI subsequently considered creating a more graphical interface, which could show the hierarchy of ownership. I first made use of D3, before concluding it would probably be better to make a native app.\nCritical Reflection Unlike most web apps and other websites, it has thus far not needed any maintenance or updating.

This is because they rely on the electrical properties of the human skin, which changes over time, often becoming less conductive with age. So, we consider the potentially increasing problem this would represent, with a layered model of skin interactions, as a frame from which to conceptualise different classes of approaches and better understand the design requirements. Conscious of the need to retain a sense of touch, rather than a stylus with a conductive tip or gloves with conductive finger tips, we then propose suitable thimbles for touchscreens. We conceptualised a touchscreen thimble to be worn on the body that would maintain a sense of touch. So a pros-palliare, rather than a prosthesis.\nThe design of the thimble consisting of two essential parts, a rigid cylindrical base, and a thin conductive fabric for the finger tip. Developing a proof of concept prototype, with Jeroen Blom, consisting of a rigid base combined with a conductive fabric for the finger tip, to address the limitations we observed with existing approaches.\nJeroen Blom made prototype thimbles resulting from exploring suitable materials.

We created a precision soldering prototype for crafting digital artefacts.\nSome consider that craftsmanship embodies the conflict between autonomy and authority. The need to be a free self-determined creator, and the equal need for that creativity to be measured against collectively-agreed upon standards of excellence. This connects craftsmanship to the tradition of upholding standards and taking time, as a source of respect and self-worth. Among those standards are the tools and practices used in crafting.\nIt has been considered that thinking through the tools we use encourages us to cultivate a form of material consciousness. So, we should consider that to use a machine is to judge its powers, fashion its uses, in light of our limits rather than its potential. We should feel the material specificity of the medium we handle, to appreciate the incompleteness, the possibility, of a design that is not provided by a machine as a fait accompli. Furthermore, assert our own individuality against the prepackaged, predetermined limitations of the tools we use. Therefore, a significant element of craftsmanship is being a toolsmith to adapt and develop one’s own tools.\nWe consider a case of precision soldering for crafting digitally enabled artefacts, which necessitated the creation of a prototype precision soldering iron. This was for use in modifying exciting electrical components, beyond a craftsperson’s skill of precision soldering.
